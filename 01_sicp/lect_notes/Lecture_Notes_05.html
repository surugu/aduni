<h3>Arithmetic with Rational Numbers</h3>

n1/d1 + n2/d2 = (n1*d2 + n2*d1) / (d1*d2)
<p>
n1/d1 - n2/d2 = (n1*d2 - n2*d1) / (d1*d2)
<p>
n1/d1 * n2/d2 = (n1*n2) / (d1*d2)
<p>
(n1/d1) / (n2/d2) = (n1*d2) / (d1*n2)
<p>
n1/d1 = n2/d2 iff n1*d2 = n2*d1
<p>

Assume that we have a constructor called <tt>make-rat</tt>, which
takes a numerator and a denominator and returns a rational number
representation.  Also assume that we have two selectors,
<tt>numer</tt> and <tt>denom</tt>.  Both selectors take a rational
number representation.  <tt>numer</tt> returns the numerator of the
rational number and <tt>denom</tt> returns the denominator of the
rational number.

<tt><pre>
(define (add-rat x y)
   (make-rat (+ (* (numer x) (denom y))
                (* (numer y) (denom x)))
             (* (denom x) (denom y))))

(define (sub-rat x y)
   (make-rat (- (* (numer x) (denom y))
                (* (numer y) (denom x)))
             (* (denom x) (denom y))))

(define (mul-rat x y)
   (make-rat (* (numer x) (numer y))
             (* (denom x) (denom y))))

(define (div-rat x y)
   (make-rat (* (numer x) (denom y))
             (* (denom x) (numer y))))

(define (equal-rat? x y)
   (= (* (numer x) (denom y))
      (* (numer y) (denom x))))
</pre></tt>

We could also write <tt>sub-rat</tt> by writing <tt>negate-rat</tt>
then using it and <tt>add-rat</tt> to define <tt>sub-rat</tt>:

<tt><pre>
(define (negate-rat x)
   (make-rat (- (numer x))
             (denom x)))

(define (sub-rat x y)
   (add-rat x (negate-rat y)))
</pre></tt>

How can we write the constructors and selectors?  Scheme has a
compound structure called a pair which is constructed with the
primitive procedure <tt>cons</tt>.  <tt>cons</tt> takes two arguments
and returns a compound data object containing the two arguments as
parts.

<tt><pre>
(define a (cons 2 3)
</pre></tt>

We can draw box and pointer diagrams to represent cons cells.  A cons
cell is drawn as two connected squares.  For the example above, the
first square would have an arrow pointing to the number 2 and the
second box would have an arrow pointing to the number 3.  See the book
or the videotaped lecture to see what they look like.
<p>

How do we get the elements from a pair?  The first box of the cons
cell is called the car.  We would write <tt>(car a)</tt>, which would
return the number 2.  The second box of the cons cell is called the
cdr.  We would write <tt>(cdr a)</tt>, which would return the number
3.
<p>
Cons pairs have the property of closure.  Anything constructed by cons
can be used as an input element to cons.  For example,

<tt><pre>
(define b (cons 7 8))

(define c (cons b 9))
</pre></tt>

How can we extract 7 from these pairs? <tt>(car b)</tt> or <tt>(car
(car c))</tt>.  We can also write <tt>(car (car c))</tt> as <tt>(caar
c)</tt>.  
<p>
How can we get 8 from these pairs?  <tt>(cdr b)</tt> or <tt>(cdr (car
c))</tt> (which can also be written as <tt>(cdar c)</tt>).
<p>
Finally, how can we get 9?  <tt>(cdr c)</tt>
<p>

Now that we know about <tt>cons</tt>, <tt>car</tt> and <tt>cdr</tt>,
let's write <tt>make-rat</tt>, <tt>numer</tt> and <tt>denom</tt>.

<tt><pre>
(define (make-rat n d) 
   (cons n d))

(define (numer x)
   (car x))

(define (denom x) 
   (cdr x))
</pre></tt>

These could also be written as follows:

<tt><pre>
(define make-rat cons)

(define numer car)

(define denom cdr)
</pre></tt>

And how can we display a rational number?

<tt><pre>
(define (print-rat x)
   (newline)
   (display (numer x))
   (display "/")
   (display (denom x)))
</pre></tt>

We're not reducing the rational numbers to the lowest terms.  How
could we do this?  By changing <tt>make-rat</tt>:

<tt><pre>
(define (make-rat n d)
   (let ((g (gcd n d)))
      (cons (/ n g) (/ d g))))
</pre></tt>

We could also implement <tt>make-rat</tt> as a procedure:

<tt><pre>
(define (make-rat n d)
   (lambda (proc) (proc n d)))

(define (numer x)
   (x (lambda (a b) a)))

(define (denom x)
   (y (lambda (a b) b)))
</pre></tt>
