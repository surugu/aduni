<h2><a name="og">Orders of Growth</a></h2>

<tt>n</tt> is a parameter that measures the size of the problem.
<p>
<tt>R(n)</tt> is the amount of resources required.  We will look at
space, <tt>S(n)</tt>, and time, <tt>T(n)</tt>.
<p>
<tt>R(n)</tt> has order of growth <tt>Theta(f(n))</tt>,
<tt>R(n)=Theta(f(n))</tt>, iff there exist positive constants <tt>k1</tt> and
<tt>k2</tt> independent of <tt>n</tt> such that
<p>
<tt>k1*f(n) <= R(n) <= k2*f(n)</tt>
<p>
for any sufficiently large value of <tt>n</tt>.

<h2><a name="ri">Recursion and Iteration</a></h2>

When multiplying, we can add the first operand to itself the number of times given by the second operand:

<pre><tt>
(mult 3 4) => 3 + 3 + 3 + 3
<tt></pre>

We can use <b>recursion</b> to write this procedure.  In recursion,
the problem is broken up into parts then built back up.  Recursion is
sometimes called "wishful thinking", where we say that we know what to
do for a problem operating on <tt>n</tt> if only we could solve the
problem for <tt>(- n 1)</tt>.
<p>
Using this idea, <tt>(mult 3 4)</tt> will be equal to <tt>3 + (mult 3 3)</tt> and
<tt>(mult 3 3) is going to be equal to <tt>3 + (mult 3 2)</tt>.
Finally, we'll get to <tt>(mult 3 0)</tt>, which will be called the
<b>base case</b>.  This is the point at which we stop calling
<tt>mult</tt> recursively and return a single value.

<pre><tt>
(define mult
   (lambda (x y)
      (if (= y 0)
          0
          (+ x 
             (mult x (- y 1))))))
</tt></pre>

Let's follow this through, using a slightly simplified substitution model:

<pre><tt>
(mult 3 4)
(+ 3 (mult 3 3))
(+ 3 (+ 3 (mult 3 2)))
(+ 3 (+ 3 (+ 3 (mult 3 1))))
(+ 3 (+ 3 (+ 3 (+ 3 (mult 3 0)))))
(+ 3 (+ 3 (+ 3 (+ 3 0))))
(+ 3 (+ 3 (+ 3 3)))
(+ 3 (+ 3 6))
(+ 3 9)
12
</tt></pre>

This procedure has T(n) = Theta(n) and S(n) = Theta(n).  T(n) is the
order of growth in terms of time, which is linear.  S(n) is the order
of growth in terms of space, which is also linear.
<p>
Observe the shape of the substitution model steps above: it arcs out
then back in.  There are deferred operations that must wait until we
reach the base case.  This is a <b>recursive process</b>: deferred
operations are stored on the stack.
<p>
A process with no deferred operations is called an <b>iterative process</b>.
We can rewrite our <tt>mult</tt> procedure iteratively:

<pre><tt>
(define mult
   (lambda (x y)
      (define mult-helper
         (lambda (y ans)
            (if (= y 0)
                ans
                (mult-helper (- y 1) (+ x ans)))))))
</tt></pre>

Note: up until now, we have been using <tt>lambda</tt> when defining
procedures.  We will now start to use the sugared version for defining
procedures.  We rewrite the iterative version of mult here to show the difference:

<pre><tt>
(define (mult x y)
   (define (mult-helper y ans)
      (if (= y 0)
          ans
          (mult-helper (- y 1) (+ x ans)))))))
</tt></pre>

Let's follow through the evaluation of <tt>(mult x y)</tt>, again
using a simplified substitution model:

<pre><tt>
(mult 3 4)
(mult-helper 4 0)
(mult-helper 3 3)
(mult-helper 2 6)
(mult-helper 1 9)
(mult-helper 0 12)
12
</tt></pre>

Again, note the shape of this computation, which is a straight line.
There are no deferred operations, making it an iterative process.
Iterative processes use constant space, which we write as S(n) =
Theta(1).  The procedure still requires linear time: T(n) = Theta(n).
<p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>recursive process</b> has delayed operations.
<li>An <b>iterative process</b> uses state variables and has no delayed operations.
</ul>
Both are <b>recursive procedures</b> since they call themselves.
<b>Process</b> describes if operators are delayed or not.
<p>
Scheme is <b>tail-recursive</b>: it executes an iterative process in
constant space.  C and Pascal are not tail-recursive; the memory grows
with the number of procedure calls.
<p>
Now let's write a faster version of our procedure to multiply by adding:

<pre><tt>
(define (fast-mult a b)
   (cond ((= b 0) 0)
         ((even? b) (fast-mult (double a) (halve b)))
         (else (+ a (fast-mult a (- b 1))))))
</tt></pre>

Let's follow the computation of <tt>(fast-mult 10 12)</tt>:

<pre><tt>
(fast-mult 10 12) 
(fast-mult 20 6)
(fast-mult 40 3)
(+ 40 (fast-mult 40 2))
(+ 40 (fast-mult 80 1))
(+ 40 (+ 80 (fast-mult 80 0)))
(+ 40 (+ 80 0))
(+ 40 80)
120
</tt></pre>

For this procedure, <tt>T(n)=Theta(log n)</tt> and <tt>S(n)=Theta(log
n)</tt>.  You can characterize Theta(log n) by thinking of the work
being divided in half at each time step.
<p>
And another version of multiplying by adding:

<pre><tt>
(define (fast-mult-2 a b)
   (define (times-iter a b result)
      (cond ((= b 0) result)
            ((even? b) (times-iter (double a) (halve b) result))
            (else (times-iter a (- b 1) (+ a result)))))
   (times-iter a b 0))
</tt></pre>

Let's follow through the evaluation of <tt>(fast-mult-2 10 12)</tt>:

<pre><tt>
(fast-mult-2 10 12)
(times-iter 10 12 0)
(times-iter 20 6 0)
(times-iter 40 3 0)
(times-iter 40 2 40)
(times-iter 80 1 40)
(times-iter 80 0 120)
120
</tt></pre>

This procedure has <tt>T(n)=Theta(log n)</tt> and <tt>S(n)=Theta(1)</tt>.

<h3>Towers of Hanoi</h3>

In the Towers of Hanoi, a tower of disks stacked in descending size
with the smallest on top needs to be moved from one peg to another
peg, using a third peg as temporary storage.  The disks can only be
moved one at a time and no disk may be placed on top of a disk that is
smaller than it.  See the videotape of the lecture for a demonstration
of moving disks from one peg to another.
<p>
This problem can be solved using the principle of "wishful thinking."
For a tower of 4 disks, if we could move the top 3 to the extra peg,
then we could move the bottom disk to the destination peg and move the
tower of size 3 to the destination peg from the extra peg.  
<p>
<tt><pre>
(define (move-tower size from to extra)
   (cond ((= size 0) nil)
         (else
            (move-tower (- size 1) from extra to)
            (print-move from to)
            (move-tower (- size 1) extra to from))))

(define (print-move from to)
   (newline)
   (display "Move top disk from ")
   (display from)
   (display " to ")
   (dispaly to))
</pre></tt>

This code is Theta(2^n) in terms of time and Theta(n) in terms of time.

<h3>Why do we care?</h3>
<table border>

<p>
At 1 billion operations per second, if you were to run an exponential
time algorithm in the lab on a data set of size n=100, you would be
waiting for approximately 4 x 10^11 <b>centuries</b> for the code to
finish running!

<h3>Space and Time</h3> 
When we talk about order of growth in terms of
<b>time</b>, we are counting the <b>number of operations</b> as a
function of the input size.<p> When we talk about order of growth in
terms of <b>space</b>, we are counting the <b>number of delayed
operations</b> as a function of the input size.<p>

<h3>Iterative vs. Recursive Processes</h3>
By definition, an iterative process uses constant space.  A process is
recursive if it is not iterative (that is, it uses more than constant
space).<p> Note that procedures that give rise to iterative processes
may be recursive procedures (that is, procedures that call
themselves).
